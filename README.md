# Jira One-Click Daily Standup Generator

## 💡 Problem
Daily standups waste time gathering updates.

A lightweight Chrome extension lives in `extension/` with a popup that builds the standup update and copies it to your clipboard.

### Load it locally

2. Enable **Developer mode**.
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select the `extension/` folder.
4. Click the extension icon to open the standup generator.
